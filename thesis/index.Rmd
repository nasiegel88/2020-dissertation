abstract: |
  Biological sequencing data has vastly expanded out knowledge of the microbial world.
  However, the generation of new sequencing data now outpaces our ability to analyze it.
  While we have standard data analysis pipelines for many data types and research questions, these pipelines sometimes fail with complex experimental designs or with complexity of sequencing data.
